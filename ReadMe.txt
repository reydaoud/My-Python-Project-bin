Hey! 
--
Thank you for considering checking my python project bin!
these are small projects, simple, humble, but I still chose to upload them to show that it doesn't matter how 
small your projects are, they still matter!

some of the interesting projects in this bin are:

- ISS tracker (Project 5)
- Rock paper scissors (Project 9)
- Extra project (bank robbing simulator Project 9)

Enjoy!
